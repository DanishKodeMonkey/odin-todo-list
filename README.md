# The odin todo list

## A basic todo list app made following the odin project exercise.

In order to put the materials learned during the odin projects Json, and OOP principles courses into practice.
I will be creating a simple todo-list app.

The idea of the exercise is to hammer in the various techniques and information I've been getting, and also adding
another great project to my belt!

I ended up spending way too much time on this because I got ahead of myself and jumped into some rabbit holes that the assignment didn't call for.
But I learned so much from this project, and it will have a special place in my heart.

The main function of this project is that you can organise your projects, and the "todos" to perform that project.
Furthermore, you can remove and project or todo you like.

The big new thing with this project compared to previous ones, is the introduction of data persistence, no more losing your data when you refresh or close the browser!

Due to this project being an exercise, the data never leaves your computer, it is stored on the browsers local storage.

Aside from that, I managed to exercise some skills of modular programming, functional programming, as well as Object Oriented programming.
It has been such a trip. It also took a solid 54-60 hours to make, mainly due to the rabbit holes, and research that went into it.

Now, ONWARDS! To the next adventure in [the odin project!](https://www.theodinproject.com/)
