# The odin todo list

## A basic todo list app made following the odin project exercise.

In order to put the materials learned during the odin projects Json, and OOP principles courses into practice.
I will be creating a simple todo-list app.

The idea of the exercise is to hammer in the various techniques and information I've been getting, and also adding
another great project to my belt!

## Project status

In the works, under the hood.
